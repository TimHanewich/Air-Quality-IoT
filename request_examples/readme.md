# Request Examples
In desgining the IoT web server code, it is helpful to have several examples of HTTP requests from several sources. I've recorded requests from several clients and have saved them here:

- [GET request from a browser (Chrome)](./browser.txt)
- [GET request from a Phone browser (Chrome on Android)](./phone_browser.txt)
- [GET request from Postman](./postman.txt)
- [GET request from Power Platform Connector (through on-premises Gateway running on local machine)](./power_platform_gateway.txt)

I am also providing a barebones [sample web server code](./test_server.py) that can run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller (MicroPython). This provides the boilerplate code required.
