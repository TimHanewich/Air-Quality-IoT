# üò∑ Home Indoor Air Quality Sensor IoT Project ü´Å
Welcome to my open-source Air Quality Sensor IoT Project! This project is aimed at monitoring your home's indoor air quality in real-time using IoT technology.

This project includes: 
- A web server, written in Python, running on a **Raspberry Pi Pico W**.
- An **ENS160 Digital Metal Oxide Multi-Gas Sensor**, used for monitoring **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**, **Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TOVC)**, and the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** of your home via the I2C protocol.
- An **AHT21 Integrated Temperature and Humidity Sensor**, used for monitoring ambient **temperature** and **humidity** of your home via the I2C protocol.
- A 3D-printed housing box for the Raspberry Pi Pico W and sensors (optional).

I am using a single breakout board that contains both an ENS160 and AHT21 on one board, found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXGZCSWG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00).

The Raspberry Pi Pico, along with the ENS160 + AHT20 sensor breakout board live neatly in a small 3D-printed enclosure:

## Web Service
The web server (written in Python) that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico W provides two services. Firstly, the `/data` endpoint performs a reading of the **Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), Air Quality Index (AQI), temperature, and humidity via the onboard ENS160 and AHT21 sensors and returns the data as JSON.

Data endpoint (API):

The second service the web server provides is a full HTML web page that can be rendered in any internet browser. The HTML page comes with client-side Javascript that consumes the `/data` endpoint mentioned above and displays it in a simple UI.
